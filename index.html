              Let's see what the scriptures say about this. First lets

                    <span class="italizied-bold">1.Scripture is the Word of God </span>
                    If you don’t believe this then anything I say from here on out is moot. The Word 
                    of God is our authority. As believers we are to we live from every Word that pro-
                    ceeds from the mouth of God. 

                    Jesus tell us in <span class="italizied-scripture">Mathew 4:4</span> and <span class="italizied-scripture">Luke 4:4</span>
                    <span class="italizied-red">“Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God"</span>

                    <span class ="italizied-scripture">2 Peter 1:16-21</span>
                    16 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known
                    unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses
                    of his majesty.
                    17 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came
                    such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I
                    am well pleased.
                    18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him
                    in the holy mount.
                    19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye
                    take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and
                    the day star arise in your hearts:
                    20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private inter-
                    pretation.
                    21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God
                    spake as they were moved
                    by the Holy Ghost.

                    What is Peter is saying?
                    Listen we were there we walked with Him, we heard God speak to us but we also
                    have something that’s more sure and that’s God’s Word!

                    What does that mean for us?
                    We have the same prophetic Words also spoken to us.  The words of men moved
                    by the Holy Spirit in which we do well to consider.

<span class="italizied-scripture">Numbers 23:19</span>
“God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent.
Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?

<span class="italizied-bold">All the promises of God are yea amen!</span>
<span class="italizied-scripture">2 Corinthians 1:15-20 (NIV) </span>
15 Because I was confident of this, I wanted to visit you first so that you might
benefit twice. 
16 I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from
Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea. 
17 Was I fickle when I intended to do this? Or do I make my plans in a worldly
manner so that in the same breath I say both “Yes, yes” and “No, no”?
18 But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and “No.”
19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me
and Silas[c] and Timothy—was not “Yes” and “No,” but in him it has always been
“Yes.” 20 For no matter how many promises God has made, they are “Yes” in Christ. 
And so through him the “Amen” is spoken by us to the glory of God. 

<span class="italizied-bold">God's Word is forever settled. "On earth as it is in heaven O' Lord"</span>

Forever, O LORD, Your word [a]is settled in heaven.

<span class="italizied-bold">The Word of God Still Stands..</span>

<span lass class="italizied-scripture">Psalm 33:66-9</span>     
6 By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, And all the host of them by 
the breath of His mouth.
7 He gathers the waters of the sea together
as a heap;He lays up the deep in storehouses.
8 Let all the earth fear the LORD; Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe
of Him.
9 For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.

<span lass class="italizied-scripture">Psalm 119:90</span> 
Your faithfulness endures to all generations;You established the earth, and it
abides.
91 They continue this day according to Your ordinances, For all are Your servants.
92 Unless Your law had been my delight, I would then have perished in my affliction.
93 I will never forget Your precepts, For by them You have given me life

<span lass class="italizied-scripture">Isaiah 55:10-11</span> 
10 “For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, And do not return there,
But water the earth, And make it bring forth and bud, That it may give seed to the
sower And bread to the eater, 
11 So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me void,
But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall prosper in the thing for which I 
sent it.
